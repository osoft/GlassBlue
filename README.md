GlassBlue
=========

An app to run on Google Glass.

It adds voice command(s) to the 'ok glass' voice menu to allow control of Yeelight Blue smart light bulbs.

For this app to work, a mobile phone with EasyBlue and BlueGlass installed must be in the same network of your Google Glass.
Currently it's using https://github.com/pocmo/Android-Network-Intents to send intent over network by udp. It's not stable. I will find a stabler way when I have time.
